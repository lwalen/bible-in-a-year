# Daily Bible Plan

A simple JavaScript tool for reading the Bible in a year, starting on any day. 
Reads verses from `/verses.json` and calculates offset from start date.

### Possible Improvements

* Use `history.pushState` to put the date in the URL. Would require redirecting all pages to index.html.
* Verse lookup time could probably be reduced by only requesting a certain day externally.
